How to Install OS-X-Voodoo-PS2-Controller

It is important that you follow these instructions as it is not a good idea to have two different ApplePS2Controller.kexts under different names. Originally the Voodoo code was packaged as ApplePS2Controller.kext as it was based on code originally from Apple. Newer versions, including this one, are called VoodooPS2Controller.kext.

In addition, as of version 1.7.4, AppleACPIPS2Nub.kext is integrated into VoodooPS2Controller.kext, and you must remove it.

So here are the instructions: (/System/Library/Extensions is abbreviated to /S/L/E)

remove /S/L/E/AppleACPIPS2Nub.kext (note: this is only for version 1.7.4 or greater)

sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/AppleACPIPS2Nub.kext
remove /S/L/E/ApplePS2Controller.kext

sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/ApplePS2Controller.kext
For versions 1.8.0, 1.8.1, and 1.8.2, ProBook users not using kozlek's branch of FakeSMC may wish to copy the ProBook specific Info.plist files (you are encouraged to use RehabMan's branch of kozlek's FakeSMC, such that this is not necessary). Assuming your current working directory is where you extracted the distribution archive:

cp ./ProBook/Trackpad-Info.plist ./Release/VoodooPS2Controller.kext/Contents/PlugIns/VoodooPS2Trackpad.kext/Contents/Info.plist
cp ./ProBook/Keyboard-Info.plist ./Release/VoodooPS2Controller.kext/Contents/PlugIns/VoodooPS2Keyboard.kext/Contents/Info.plist
install VoodooPS2Controller.kext using your favorite Kext installer (Kext Wizard) (note: for versions prior to 1.7.4, you must install AppleACPIPS2Nub.kext as well)

starting with version 1.7.8, install the VoodooPS2Daemon

sudo cp org.rehabman.voodoo.driver.Daemon.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
sudo cp VoodooPS2Daemon /usr/bin
optional: rebuild permissions and kernel cache

reboot
